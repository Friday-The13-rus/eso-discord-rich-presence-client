# Discord Status Updater for ESO (using Rich Presence)

This little program is made using the .Net 4.6.1 framework and sends Rich Presence data to your local Discord client, making your status say more than just "Playing **Elder Scrolls Online**", including info about your current location, your level, your current party, and more! While running, your presence should look like this:
